                <p style="text-align: justify;">Neubloc is a U.S.-based, outsource software design and development firm — founded in 1999 — that employs a unique Rightsource model, coupling the best of nearshore design and project management with highly educated, experienced, and proven engineering resources nearshore and offshore. Neubloc resources can be found in our offices throughout North America, nearshore operations with Argentinean and Ecuadorian locations, and offshore in multiple cities under management by our Central and Eastern European locations. We transcend the failed offshore models of the past and the broken promises of cost and time savings never achieved. We understand that work shipped offshore will fail without defined processes, clear communications, and the right balance of onshore, nearshore and offshore resources that can work in concert to deliver 7/24 productivity. Only when this equilibrium has been found can productivity and savings be delivered.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Neubloc is headquartered in San Diego, with offices in Oklahoma City, Poland, Ecuador and Argentina. We draw on our teams’ many years of experience to develop market-driven solutions, delivered by our strategy consultants, designers, and experienced engineering teams worldwide. These teams understand how to solve tough customer challenges with creative, market-driven, and scalable solutions that are built on solid technical foundations, utilize leading-edge technologies and extend communication capabilities to a mobile audience.</p>
